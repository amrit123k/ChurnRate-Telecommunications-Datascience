A machine learning pipeline designed to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company using structured customer data. The project handles real-world challenges such as class imbalance, multiple datasets, and feature engineering to develop an accurate predictive model.
The workflow includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand churn patterns
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering to clean and enhance the dataset
- Model training and comparison using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and CatBoost
- CatBoostClassifier, which performed best, is used for final deployment
- Metrics like ROC AUC and F1 Score used to evaluate model performance
- Class imbalance addressed via balanced class weights and metric-focused evaluation

This project is ideal for understanding applied ML in customer analytics and can serve as a strong foundation for business retention strategies or further model deployment.
